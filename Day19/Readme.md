## Why **VS Code** is Important for **Terraform**

Terraform is used to **write code to create cloud infrastructure** (VMs, networks, storage, etc.).
To write and manage this code **easily and correctly**, we use **VS Code**.

---

## 1️⃣ Easy to Write Terraform Code

VS Code understands Terraform files (`.tf`).

* It highlights keywords like `provider`, `resource`, `variable`
* Code looks clean and readable

👉 This helps you **understand what you are writing**.

---

## 2️⃣ Auto Suggestions (Very Important)

When you start typing a resource, VS Code suggests options.

Example:

* You type `resource "azurerm_`
* VS Code shows available Azure resources

👉 This **reduces typing mistakes** and saves time.

---

## 3️⃣ Finds Errors Early

VS Code shows errors while you are typing:

* Missing arguments
* Wrong syntax
* Invalid blocks

👉 You can **fix mistakes before running Terraform commands**.

---

## 4️⃣ One Tool for Coding + Running Commands

VS Code has a **built-in terminal**.

You can run:

* `terraform init`
* `terraform plan`
* `terraform apply`

👉 No need to open a separate command prompt.

---

## 5️⃣ Proper Formatting

VS Code formats Terraform code automatically:

* Correct indentation
* Clean structure

👉 Code looks **professional and interview-ready**.

---

## 6️⃣ Works Well with Git (DevOps Use)

VS Code tracks:

* What code you changed
* Previous versions

👉 This is **very important in DevOps and team projects**.

---

## 7️⃣ Helps in Learning & Real Projects

For beginners:

* Easy to learn Terraform syntax
  For professionals:
* Manage large Terraform projects

👉 VS Code grows with your skill level.
