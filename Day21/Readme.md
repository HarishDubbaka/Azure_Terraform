# Terraform Daily Essentials

Today I focused on essential Terraform commands that are used daily while working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
Mastering these commands helps in planning, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure efficiently.

## Core Commands

- **terraform init**  
  Initializes a new or existing Terraform configuration. Downloads providers and sets up the working directory.

- **terraform plan**  
  Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take without actually applying them.

- **terraform apply**  
  Executes the actions proposed in the plan to provision or update infrastructure.

- **terraform destroy**  
  Removes all resources defined in the configuration, useful for cleanup.

- **terraform validate**  
  Checks whether the configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent.

- **terraform fmt**  
  Formats Terraform configuration files to a canonical style.

- **terraform show**  
  Displays the current state or a saved plan file in a human-readable format.

- **terraform output**  
  Extracts and displays values defined as outputs in your configuration.

- **terraform state**  
  Advanced command to inspect or modify Terraform’s state file.

## Why These Matter
These commands form the backbone of daily Terraform workflows. By mastering them, you can:
- Plan infrastructure changes safely before applying.  
- Deploy cloud resources consistently.  
- Manage lifecycle operations like updates and teardown.  
- Keep configurations clean, validated, and well-documented.
